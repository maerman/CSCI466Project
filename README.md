+ ## CSCI466Project

The purpose of our project is to create a top down shooter game that is controlled by the user’s keyboard and/or controller. The game allows the user to navigate a vehicle in the space of the screen and shoot at hostile objects. While avoiding obstacles such as projectiles and debris. As the user progresses in the game he/she will have the opportunity to collect power-ups and move on to new levels. The game will have a login screen where were your best score and progress will be saved. Additionally, scores are saved to an online leaderboard where all user scores will be saved together with the user’s profile name (entered at the end of the player’s session) and that user’s total session time. The game will also be playable on our website.

We will be using online gaming engine such as Unity to create the game. The game will be fully online at our website.
